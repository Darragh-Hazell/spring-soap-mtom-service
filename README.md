# spring-soap-mtom-service

This repo is designed to act as an example of a SOAP api web service, created using the Spring Framework, which utilises the MTOM protocol for its data transfer. 
I created this repo primarily because I encountered difficulty integrating MTOM into a SOAP service I needed to create.
